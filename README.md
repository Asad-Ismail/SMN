## All with One Image Net (SMN)

A Scaleable MultiTask Network for image-based Object detection, Instance segmenation, Keypoint detection, Classification and Regression. 
We will motivate the problem by an example. Suppose we want to do vegetable phenotyping(Finding the traits of vegetables) using imaging. We are intetrested in multiple traits of each fruit like length, width, backbone(curved_height), neck and overall rating of each fruit. Where neck and overall rating of each fruit is determied by breeder and is given a categorical score form 1-5. where 1 is bad and 5 is good. Below is an example of such an image and its annotation
